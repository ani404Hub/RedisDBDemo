# RedisDBDemo
Redis is an open-source in-memory data store and can be used for caching mechanism
We are using Redis with Jedis version 3.3.0 which only supports Java 8, The above version of Java is incompatible with this version of Jedis
Integrate with Redis database rather than using Oracle DB
Further applied caching mechanism to reduce the number of DB calls while fetching data
Simple project with added comments to have a better understanding of each line
